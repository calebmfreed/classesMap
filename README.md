==========

This was going to be a one stop shop app for student organization. It was going to feature calendar integration, class reminders, homework schedules,
class schedules, and a map and routes to each class. It allowed the student to select classes from a list, it would then pull the 
time of class, professor, location, and relevant discussion information from the uiuc class servers.

It sounded like a great idea, but then I found out that Google Maps doesn't know the names of all of the buildings on campus, so
locating them on a map proved difficult unless each building was hard coded in. To be continued...
